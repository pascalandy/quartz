    "content": "\n```toc\nTable of Content\n```\n\n**Eager to try the demo of the template?** üëâ [digital-garden-jekyll-template.netlify.app](https://digital-garden-jekyll-template.netlify.app/)\n\nDigital gardens and public note-taking spaces are [all the rage these days](https://twitter.com/ness_labs/status/1262778800649187330), as they‚Äôre a great way to foster an environment where ideas mesh together and others can take inspiration from. You can set up a digital garden of your own in a few minutes, and have your own personal corner of the Internet where you‚Äôll seed and grow ideas.\n\nIf you‚Äôre familiar with Markdown and/or HTML, you‚Äôll be right at home, as that‚Äôs how your notes will be formatted.\n\nThe end result will look similar to this:\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8457808/82400515-7d026d80-9a25-11ea-83f1-3b9cb8347e07.png)\n\nIf you happen to use **Obsidian** to work on your notes, you‚Äôll likely want to open [this guide from Mike](https://refinedmind.co/obsidian-jekyll-workflow) and read through it in parallel with this one.\n\nAlternatively, if you use **Roam** and would like to automatically convert your Roam Research backup to a garden using this template, take a look at [this repository](https://github.com/DoomHammer/roam-to-git/tree/roam-to-garden).\n\nWithout further ado, let‚Äôs get started!\n\n## Instructions\n\n### 0. Set up prerequisites\n\nFor this tutorial, we‚Äôll need to install a few things on your machine (you may have some of these already). Following the instructions on each website to install them.\n\n- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)\n  - `brew install ruby@2.7`\n- [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/)\n  - `sudo gem install bundler:2.2.3`\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n\nYou‚Äôll also need to create accounts on the following services:\n\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/join) (to store your digital garden files)\n- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/signup) (to serve your digital garden website to the world)\n\nOnce everything is set up, let‚Äôs start creating your own digital garden.\n\n### 1. Create a fork of the template repository\n\nTo simplify things, I provide the template shown in the image above to get started. You can always tweak this template to your taste later.\n\nVisit the GitHub page for my template repository ([`maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template`](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template)), and fork it to your account using the Fork button:\n\nOnce the forking process is complete, you should have a fork (essentially a copy) of my template in your own GitHub account. On the GitHub page for your repository, click on the green ‚ÄúClone or download‚Äù button, and copy the URL: we‚Äôll need it for the next step.\n\n### 2. Clone your repository locally\n\nNext, we want to download the files from your GitHub repository onto your local machine. To do this, replace `\u003cYOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE\u003e` in the command below with the URL you copied in the previous step, then execute this command:\n\n```\n$ git clone \u003cYOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE\u003e my-digital-garden\n```\n\nAs a reference point, this is how it looks like for me (the difference is likely just the GitHub username):\n\n```\n$ git clone git@github.com:maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template.git my-digital-garden\n```\n\nThen, navigate into the directory that was just created:\n\n### 3. Test out the site locally\n\nSweet! You now have your repository‚Äôs source code on your machine. Within the `my-digital-garden` directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies like Jekyll:\n\n#### CA DEVIENT S√âRIEUX ICI\n\n```\ncd /Users/andy16/Documents/github_pascalandy/notes-to-jekyll\n```\n\ninstall deps:\n\n```\nbundle\n```\n\nOnce that‚Äôs done, ask Jekyll to start serving the site locally:\n\n```\nbundle exec jekyll serve\n```\n\nOpen up [`http://localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000/) in your browser.\n\nIf everything‚Äôs done correctly, you should now see the home page of your digital garden. üéâ\n\nKeep in mind that this site is only available locally (notice the `localhost` part of the URL), so if we want it to be available on the Internet for everyone to enjoy, we need to deploy it to the Internet: we‚Äôll use Netlify for that in the next step.\n\n### 4. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify\n\nNetlify lets you automatically deploy your digital garden on to the Internet when you update your GitHub repository. To do this, we need to connect your GitHub repository to Netlify:\n\n1. Log in to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)\n2. Once logged in, click the ‚ÄúNew site from Git‚Äù button\n3. On the next page, select GitHub as the continuous deployment provider (you may need to authorize the connection, in which case, approve it)\n4. On the next page, select your digital garden repository from the list\n5. On the next page, keep the default settings, and click on ‚ÄúDeploy site‚Äù.\n\nThat was easy! We‚Äôre almost done.\n\nWait a couple of minutes for the initial deploy to complete.\n\nOnce that‚Äôs done, your digital garden should be available on the Internet via a generic Netlify URL, which you can change to a custom domain later if you‚Äôd like.\n\nNow the cool thing is this: whenever you push an update to your GitHub repository, Netlify will automatically deploy your updates to the Internet.\n\n### 5. Start tending to your digital garden\n\nAt this point, you can start updating the files on your machine (in the `my-digital-garden` folder) to change your digital garden to your liking: update the copy, add some notes, tweak the layout, customize the colors, etc.\n\nOnce you have something you‚Äôre happy with, push your changes to your GitHub repository with the following commands:\n\n```bash\nfunction obsidian_ssg {\n\n# STEP_1B / From my mac\n\nDIR_FROM=\"/Users/andy16/Documents/_my_docs/51_office_CV/vault_obsidian/_cards/_public_ssg_pascalandy/\"\n\nDIR_INTO=\"/Users/andy16/Documents/github_pascalandy/notes-to-jekyll/_notes/\"\n\nGIT_REPO=\"/Users/andy16/Documents/github_pascalandy/notes-to-jekyll\"\n\nDATE=\"$(date '+%Y-%m-%d_%HH%M')\";\n\ncd \"${GIT_REPO}\" \u0026\u0026 pwd \u0026\u0026 /\n\nrsync -arvh ${DIR_FROM} ${DIR_INTO} \u0026\u0026 /\n\ncd \"${GIT_REPO}\" \u0026\u0026 pwd \u0026\u0026 /\n\ngit add . \u0026\u0026 /\n\ngit commit -m 'Update content ${DATE}' \u0026\u0026 /\n\ngit push origin main;\n\n}\n```\n\nIf that command succeeds and the rest of the tutorial was done correctly, in a couple of minutes, you should see your changes live on your Netlify website. üöÄ\n\nAnd we‚Äôre done! You now have your own digital garden. Take care of your mind and the rest will follow. üçÉ\n",

Ideally, it's here to help you start your own garden.\n\n## What is \"digital gardening\"?\n\nA garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. It's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory ‚Äì posts are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal \"blogs\" we're used to encountering on the web.\n\nSee the [Theory, Philosophy, and Navel-gazing](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners#theory-philosophy-and-navel-gazing) section for more on the 'what' of gardens.\n\n[![An illustration of a plant with an pencil edit icon](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0a0deaca138fb191991b0eaff14e26ce82ca8e257ff1c92c4909d1354cec655d/68747470733a2f2f7265732e636c6f7564696e6172792e636f6d2f64673367796b3067752f696d6167652f75706c6f61642f635f7363616c652c775f3835302f76313539303430313933372f6d61676769656170706c65746f6e2e636f6d2f6e6f7465732f67617264656e2d686973746f72792f67617264656e2d776964652e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0a0deaca138fb191991b0eaff14e26ce82ca8e257ff1c92c4909d1354cec655d/68747470733a2f2f7265732e636c6f7564696e6172792e636f6d2f64673367796b3067752f696d6167652f75706c6f61642f635f7363616c652c775f3835302f76313539303430313933372f6d61676769656170706c65746f6e2e636f6d2f6e6f7465732f67617264656e2d686973746f72792f67617264656e2d776964652e706e67)\n\n## Gardening Tools\n\n#### Building a Public Garden\n\n- [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) - A personal notes system for interconnected thought\n  - See the following resources for converting your private garden in Roam to a public garden:\n    - [Roam Garden](https://roam.garden/) a service that does all the setup for you based on JSON export\n    - [Gatsby Theme Garden](https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden/) Gatsby theme that supports using Roam as a source\n    - [Roam-to-Garden](https://github.com/DoomHammer/roam-to-git/tree/roam-to-garden) Jekyll based converter for your Roam Data\n- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - a Roam-like knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.

[I wrote a guide explaining how to set this up](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).\n\nIf you don't care about the graph, you can simply remove it from this layout, [as explained here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/discussions/132#discussioncomment-3625772).\n\n## License\n\nSource code is available under the [MIT license](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/blob/main/LICENSE.md).\n",
